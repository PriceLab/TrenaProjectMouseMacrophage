!Sample_data_processing = Reads were aligned to the Mus musculus genome (mm10 build) using STAR v2.3.0 (Dobin et al. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635) in supervised mode using the Ensemble GRCm38.71 gene annotation as template. Relevant alignment parameters are: --outFilterMultimapScoreRange 0.75  --outFilterMultimapNmax 100 --outFilterMismatchNmax 25 --outFilterScoreMinOverLread 0.75 --outFilterMatchNminOverLread 0.75 --outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.25 --sjdbOverhang 99
!Sample_data_processing = HTSeq-count v0.5.4p3 (Simon Anders, http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/) was used to compute the matrix of raw counts (relevant paramters: --mode=intersection-strict). Gene expression estimates were generated after normalizing for sequencing depth and effective gene length
